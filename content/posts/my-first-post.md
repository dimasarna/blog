Hello everyone this is my first attempt to build my own blog with hugo, a fast static site generator.
This will be starting my journey as content writer. My first content will be about **Rust** programming language.
As **Rust** are now popular for replacing the **C** language, and because I have basic in **C/C++**, why don't I try to learn **Rust** and let's see the *pros* and *cons* between the two!
